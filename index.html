    <p>A website for my OCs and their descriptions. I'll have a variety of OCs (like Pokémon!) so that when I get bored of one, I can switch to another while maintaining the one I was bored of for later. This means I can develop character (which I want to do!) without feeling like I have to commit to a single one!</p>
